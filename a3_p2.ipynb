The notebook begins by defining helper functions to simulate various types of missing data (MCAR, MAR, MNAR) and evaluate imputation methods. It then explores the dataset, transforms categorical features into numerical format to facilitate their use in analysis, and concludes with an evaluation of median, KNN, and MICE imputation techniques."

    "Median imputation is computationally efficient and suitable for MCAR or low-correlation MAR data, where missingness is random and variable relationships are negligible. However, its simplicity becomes a weakness in high-correlation MAR and MNAR scenarios, as it ignores interdependencies between variables, leading to skewed imputations.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN imputation offers a middle ground, improving upon median in high-correlation MAR and MNAR settings by leveraging local similarity, but at the cost of increased computational load (scaling with dataset size and neighborhood selection). Its sensitivity to noise or sparse data limits its utility in MCAR or low-correlation MAR cases, where median imputation is both faster and comparably accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "MICE excels in accuracy across all missingness mechanisms, particularly where variable relationships matter (high-correlation MAR, MNAR), thanks to its iterative modeling of interdependencies. However, this comes with high computational complexity, making it less practical for large datasets or time-sensitive applications."
